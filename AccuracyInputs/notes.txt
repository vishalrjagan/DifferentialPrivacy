1. svt1-6 are like sparse but they reuse a single noisy threshold. May
need to rewrite these to match Sparse. Or perhaps this is a chance to
prove inaccuracy. If these verify, it still doesn't prove a general
claim about the algorithm because we're only testing finite set of
inputs.

2. svt7 is the Sparse algorithm of Dwork and Roth 3. nmax5 comes from
a paper. Does success for this one imply success for the less private
(possibly more accurate) svt1-6?

3. Where is the noisy max beta expression coming from?
